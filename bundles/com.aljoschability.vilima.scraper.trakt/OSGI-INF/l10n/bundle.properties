extension.description = Trakt is a platform that does many things, but primarily keeps track of TV shows and movies you watch. It integrates with your media center or home theater PC to enable scrobbling, so everything is automatic. Some people like to check in from their phone, so we enable that too. Discover new shows and movies, follow people with similar tastes and voice your opinion on by using the trakt website or one of the many community apps that were built using our API.
